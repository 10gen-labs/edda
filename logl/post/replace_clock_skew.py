#Make sure you run this file after you run clock_skew.py

#General plan of action for this method:
    #Run a loop to make sure you haven't already gone through the server that you are on.
    #It will run through the first time.
    #Loop for each entry in the partners field of the specific server that you are on
        #Isolate messages that have the origin server the same as the partners field
        #Loop through each message and adjust clock skew for each server individually
        #Along the way, add each server to a list that has already been checked. From here on out, we will only be going through servers not on this list

        #Move on to the next server and continue
    #Since the time deltas should be signed, we should be able to add the time skews of the different servers together. 
    #This should work for the case of the line of servers where every server is connected to every other server

# anatomy of a clock skew document:
# document = {
#    "type" = "clock_skew"
#    "server_name" = "name"
#    "partners" = {
#          server_name : 
#                [time_delay1 : weight1, time_delay2 : weight2, ...]
#          }
#     }
