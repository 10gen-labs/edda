    "stale"    : a secondary is going stale
    "exit"     : a replica set is exiting
    "lock"     : a server requests to lock itself from writes
    "unlock"   : a server requests to unlock itself from writes
    "reconfig" : new config information was received

    This module assumes that normal network delay can account
    for up to 4 seconds of lag between server logs.  Beyond this
    margin, module assumes that servers are no longer in sync.
