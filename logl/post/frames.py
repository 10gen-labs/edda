# This document will get information from another module
# that organizes the animation information by order
# of events for each server, with values adjusted for
# clock skew.  This module will change that information into a
# series of 'frames' that will be passed up to the javascript
# program to interpret and animate.  The documents this module
# generates will include the following information:

# time : (int, in seconds?)
# server_count : (int)
# body_count : (int)
# flag : (something conflicted about this view of the world? boolean)
# bodies (servers/users): [
       # name : (current_state, prev_state)...
# ]
# syncs: [
       # from_1 : to_1...
# ]
# user_conns: [
       # from_1 : to_1...
# ]

    # view the world in the same way.  If it detects something
    # amiss between two or more servers, it will set the 'flag'
    # to true, but will do nothing further.
