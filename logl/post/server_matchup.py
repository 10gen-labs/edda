def address_matchup(db, collName):
    """Runs an algorithm to match servers with their
    corresponding hostnames/IP addresses.  The algorithm works as follows,
    using replica set status messages from the logs to find addresses:

    - Make a list, mentioned_names of all the IPs being talked about;
    these must be all the servers in the network.
    - For each server (S) in the collName.servers collection, if it
    already has been matched to an IP address and hostname, remove
    these addresses from mentioned_names.  Move to next server.
    - Else, make a list of the addresses (S) mentions, neighbors_of_s
    - If (S) has a known IP address or hostname:
        (stronger algorithm)
        - find all neighbors of (S) and the addresses they mention (their neighbors)
        - Make a list of addresses that ALL neighbors of (S) mention, neighbor_neighbors
        - By process of elimination between neighbors_of_s and neighbors_neighbors, see if
    there remains one address in neighbors_neighbors that (S) has not
    mentioned in its log entries.  This must be (S)'s address.  Remove this
    address from mentioned_names.
    - Else (weaker algorithm):
        - By process of elimination between neighbors_of_s and mentioned_names,
    see if there remains one address in mentioned_names that (S) has not
    mentioned in its log entries.  This must be (S)'s address.  Remove this
    address from mentioned_names.
    - Repeat this process until mentioned_names is empty trying each server
    round-robin, or until all servers have been unsuccessfully tried since the last
    change was made to mentioned_names.

    This algorithm is only sound when the user provides a
    log file from every server in the network, and complete when
    the network graph was complete, or was a tree (connected and acyclic)"""
