+ Pip:

+ MongoDB (which you should do anyway because it is awesome)

  see http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

+ PyMongo, MongoDB's language driver for Python:

  $ pip install pymongo

+ argparse:

  $ pip install argparse

+ Install a non-text-based browser

  We recommend Google Chrome or Firefox.

+ Install Edda:

  $ pip install edda

RUN
---

Give the log files from your servers as command-line
arguments to the visualizer:

	  $ python edda.py --options filename1 filename2 ...
(see python edda.py --help for options)

Edda can read in multiple log files at once.

NOTE: please only give log files from the same server cluster!


There are some sample log files in edda/sample_logs you can run
if you don't have any log files of your own yet.
